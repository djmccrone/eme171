<p>If it is impossible to make office hours, schedule an appointment with Jason by
checking his <a class="reference external" href="http://www.moorepants.info/work-calendar.html">work calendar</a> and select a free time between 8:00 AM and 6:30
PM Monday-Friday. Send him an email requesting an appointment at the suggested
meeting times at least a day in advance. You can also email Kevin and request a
meeting.</p>

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please visit the <a class="reference external" href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/academic-integrity.html">Academic Integrity
web page</a> from UC Davis
Office of Student Judicial Affairs to review the campus' policy on academic
responsibility and integrity and read the UC Davis <a class="reference external" href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html">code of academic conduct</a>.</p>
<p>Feel free to discuss homework assignments and work on them together, but each
student must turn in a <em>unique</em> solution. Keep in mind that actually doing all
of the homework yourself is critical for learning and passing the course.</p>
<p>No help from other people or non-approved resources are allowed when completing
the midterm and final exam.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="textbook">
<h2>Textbook</h2>
<p>We will use the following book as the official and required textbook:</p>
<blockquote>
<em>System Dynamics: Modeling, Simulation, and Control of Mechatronic Systems</em>,
Dean C. Karnopp, Donald L. Margolis, and Ronald C. Rosenberg, 5th Edition,
2012, Wiley, ISBN 978-0-4708-8908-4 [<a class="reference external" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118152812">Book Information</a>]</blockquote>
<p>If connected through the UC Davis network, you can download a copy of the book
for free from the above link.</p>
<p>Past editions of the book are likely sufficient but the problem sets will not
necessarily match. We will also provide you with free online resources and
other supplementary materials.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="assignments-grades">
<h2>Assignments &amp; Grades</h2>
<p>Grades will be available in the <a class="reference external" href="http://canvas.ucdavis.edu">canvas.ucdavis.edu</a> grade book periodically
throughout the course along with class statistics. Check the website on a
regular basis to gauge your performance. Keep in mind that <strong>15% is deducted
per business day late on lab reports. Homework must be turned in on time to
count.</strong></p>

<dt>Homework</dt>
<dd>Weekly homework will be assigned from the book problems which will be due on
Monday's by midnight (except during exam weeks). Unique solutions are
required from each student but you are allowed to work with anyone on the
homework and help each other. You can miss up to two homework submissions
out of the total and still get the full 15% credit. Graded on pass/fail for
showing complete work on all problems. There is no partial credit and
homework will not be accepted past the due date and time. You should scan or
photograph your homework and submit them as a single PDF file. Solutions
will be shared after the due date on Canvas.</dd>
<dt>Lab Reports</dt>
<dd>The labs will be done in pairs of two students. Each student is expected to
contribute significantly to all aspects of the lab: understanding the
problem, formulating a solution, writing code, and writing the report. Every
student in the class is individually responsible for competence in
simulation/analysis tools and methods used to complete the labs. Lab reports
will be collected approximately every two weeks on Fridays and graded based
on a provided rubric. Reports should be typed and submitted as a PDF file to
Canvas. Each lab report due date will be preceded by multiple lab sessions
lead by the teaching assistant. Each student is required to attend at least
one of the lab sessions during the two week period before the lab report is
due. Attendance will be taken and being absent will count against the pair's
grade.</dd>
<dt>Midterm</dt>
<dd>You will have to complete a 50 minute in-class midterm exam.</dd>
<dt>Final</dt>
<dd>You will have to complete a two-hour in-class final exam.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="section" id="canvas">
<h2>Canvas</h2>
<p>We will make use of Canvas for the course. Log in to <a class="reference external" href="http://canvas.ucdavis.edu">canvas.ucdavis.edu</a> with
your Kerberos ID and passphrase then select <strong>EME 171 001 FQ 2019</strong>.</p>
<p>We will be using several features in canvas:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Announcements</dt>
<dd>This will be my primary communication avenue to you. These announcements
will be forwarded automatically to your UCD email address. You are expected
to read these either through your email program or on the Canvas website.</dd>
<dt>Assignments</dt>
<dd>Any electronic assignments will be distributed and collected here.</dd>
<dt>Discussions</dt>
<dd>Ask all class related questions here unless they are of a personal nature.</dd>
<dt>Grades</dt>
<dd>Your grades and basic stats on your relative performance will be available
as the course goes along.</dd>
<dt>Files</dt>
<dd>Copyrighted and private files, documents, and other resources will be
available here for download. The rest will be available for download on this

<h2>Communications</h2>
<div class="section" id="canvas-discussions">
<h3>Canvas Discussions</h3>
<p>Canvas discussions should be used for all questions about the class, homework,
theory, projects, etc that is not of a private nature. This allows both the
instructors and students to collectively answer questions for the whole classes
benefit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="email">
<h3>Email</h3>
<p>Personal electronic correspondence from the instructors will be made to your
UCD email address. It is your responsibility to check this regularly.</p>
<p>Electronic announcements from the instructors to the whole class will be made
through Canvas. By default, Canvas will automatically send the announcement to
your UCD email address. You can change your Canvas settings to opt out, send it
to a different email, or as an SMS. You are responsible for reading the
announcements made via canvas.</p>
