<p>If it is impossible to make office hours, schedule an appointment with Jason by
checking his <a class="reference external" href="http://www.moorepants.info/work-calendar.html">work calendar</a> and select a free time between 8:00 AM and 6:30
PM Monday-Friday. Send him an email requesting an appointment at the suggested
meeting times at least a day in advance. You can also email Ehsan and request a
meeting.</p>

<div class="section" id="academic-integrity">
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please visit the <a class="reference external" href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/academic-integrity.html">Academic Integrity
web page</a> from UC Davis
Office of Student Judicial Affairs to review the campus' policy on academic
responsibility and integrity and read the UC Davis <a class="reference external" href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html">code of academic conduct</a>.</p>
<p>Feel free to discuss homework assignments and work on them together, but each
student must turn in a <em>unique</em> solution. Keep in mind that actually doing all
of the homework yourself is critical for learning and passing the course.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="textbook">
<h2>Textbook</h2>
<p>We will use the following book as the official and required textbook:</p>
<blockquote>
<em>System Dynamics: Modeling, Simulation, and Control of Mechatronic Systems</em>,
Dean C. Karnopp, Donald L. Margolis, and Ronald C. Rosenberg, 5th Edition,
2012, Wiley, ISBN 978-0-4708-8908-4 [<a class="reference external" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118152812">Book Information</a>]</blockquote>
<p>Past editions of the book are likely sufficient but the problem sets will not
necessarily match. We will also provide you with free online resources and
other supplementary materials.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="assignments-grades">
<h2>Assignments &amp; Grades</h2>
<p>Grades will be available in the <a class="reference external" href="http://canvas.ucdavis.edu">canvas.ucdavis.edu</a> grade book periodically
throughout the course along with class statistics. Check the website on a
regular basis to gauge your performance. Keep in mind that <strong>15% is deducted
per business day late</strong> on all assignments.</p>

<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Projects/Homework</dt>
<dd>Weekly homework will be assigned which will be due before class the
following week. Unique solutions are required from each student.
Projects will be done in group sof thre students; students are individually
responible for competence in simulation/analysis tools. Project reports will
be collected and graded during the quarter. Homework will be submitted with
the final examination.</dd>
<dt>Midterm</dt>
<dd>You will have to complete a take-home midterm exam. You may not work with
others on this exam.</dd>
<dt>Final</dt>
<dd>You will have to complete a two-hour in-class exam.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="canvas">
<h2>Canvas</h2>
<p>We will make use of Canvas for the course. Log in to <a class="reference external" href="http://canvas.ucdavis.edu">canvas.ucdavis.edu</a> with
your Kerberos ID and passphrase then select <strong>EME 171 001 WQ 2019</strong>.</p>
<p>We will be using several features in canvas:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Announcements</dt>
<dd>This will be my primary communication avenue to you. These announcements
will be forwarded automatically to your UCD email address. You are expected
to read these either through your email program or on the Canvas website.</dd>
<dt>Assignments</dt>
<dd>Any electronic assignments will be distributed and collected here.</dd>
<dt>Grades</dt>
<dd>Your grades and basic stats on your relative performance will be available
as the course goes along.</dd>
<dt>Files</dt>
<dd>Copyrighted and private files, documents, and other resources will be
available here for download. The rest will be available for download on this
website.</dd>

<h2>Communications</h2>
<div class="section" id="email">
<h3>Email</h3>
<p>Personal electronic correspondence from the instructors will be made to your
UCD email address. It is your responsibility to check this regularly.</p>
<p>Electronic announcements from the instructors to the whole class will be made
through Canvas. By default, Canvas will automatically sends the announcement to
your UCD email address. You can change your Canvas settings to opt out, send it
to a different email, or as an SMS. You are responsible for reading the
announcements made via canvas.</p>
