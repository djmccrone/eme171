<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the last lab, you simulated a one degree-of-freedom quarter car suspension
model. Here we present a two degree-of-freedom quarter car suspension model in
which the additional degree-of-freedom captures the simplified
compression/extension of the tire between the wheel hub and the ground.
Similar to the prior lab, the goal is to simulate this system to see the
response as it is driven over a pothole.</p>
<p>To view the system response to driving over a pothole, you need to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Determine the state equations, states, constant parameters, inputs, initial
conditions, and outputs.</li>
<li>Write the functions for calculating the state derivatives, inputs, and
outputs.</li>
<li>Simulate the system and plot the desired responses.</li>
<li>Interpret and explain the results.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="model-description">
<h2>Model Description</h2>
<p>The sprung mass, <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, represents a quarter of the weight of the car that
is located above the shock absorber. The shock absorber is represented by a
linear spring and damper in parallel. The unsprung mass, <span class="math">\(M_u\)</span>,
represents the mass of the wheel and tire. The spring between the unsprung mass
and the ground represents the stiffness of the tire. Power flowing from the
system to the ground is considered positive (note the direction in which
positive velocity is defined).</p>

model and (right) a bond graph representing the system</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="state-equations-and-states">
<h3>State Equations and States</h3>
<p>The state equations derived from the bond graph are as follows:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
\dot{p}_2 &amp; = -\frac{B}{M}p_2 - Kq_6 + \frac{B}{M}_up_8 + Mg  \\
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
\dot{q}_6 &amp; = \frac{1}{M}p_2 - \frac{1}{M}p_8  \\
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
\dot{p}_8 &amp; = \frac{B}{M}p_2 + Kq_6 - \frac{B}{M_u}p_8 - K_tq_{11} + M_ug \\
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
\dot{q}_{11} &amp; = \frac{1}{M_u}p_8 - v_i \\
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>where the time varying states are defined as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(p_2\)</span>: vertical momentum of the sprung mass [kg m/s]</li>
<li><span class="math">\(q_6\)</span>: displacement between the sprung and unsprung mass [m]</li>
<li><span class="math">\(p_8\)</span>: vertical momentum of the unsprung mass [kg m/s]</li>
<li><span class="math">\(q_{11}\)</span>: displacement between the unsprung mass and the ground [m]</li>
</ul>
<p>It will once again be useful to find the vertical displacement of the road,
<span class="math">\(y_i\)</span> [m], to visualize the shape of the road. An additional state
equation can be added to the above minimal set of equations to calculate the
road height:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\dot{y}_i = v_i
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="constant-parameters">
<h3>Constant Parameters</h3>
<p>The quarter car is defined by the following constant parameters:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sprung mass: <span class="math">\(M = 250 \textrm{kg}\)</span></li>
<li>Ratio of the sprung and unsprung masses: <span class="math">\(\frac{M}{M_u} = 5\)</span></li>
<li>Acceleration due to gravity: <span class="math">\(g=9.81 \textrm{ms}^{-2}\)</span></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_frequency">Natural frequency</a> of the sprung mass: <span class="math">\(f_n=1 \textrm{Hz}\)</span></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping_ratio">Damping ratio</a> of the sprung mass: <span class="math">\(\zeta=0.3\)</span></li>
<li>Ratio of the tire and suspension spring stiffnesses: <span class="math">\(\frac{K_t}{K} = 10\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The pothole input is defined by the following constant parameters:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Forward speed of the car: <span class="math">\(V_c = 10 \textr{ms}^{-1}\)</span></li>
<li>Width of the pothole: <span class="math">\(L = 1.2 \textrm{m}\)</span></li>
<li>Depth of the pothole: <span class="math">\(A = 0.08 \textrm{m}\)</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="initial-conditions">
<h3>Initial Conditions</h3>
<p>The initial velocities of the two masses should be set to zero, which implies
that the momentums are also zero:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
p_2 = 0 \textrm{ at } t = 0
p_8 = 0 \textrm{ at } t = 0
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The initial conditions of the displacements, <span class="math">\(q_6,q_{11}\)</span>, should reflect
the equilibrium state of the springs. To find the equilibrium value of the two
displacements, set the momentums, their time derivatives, the time derivatives
of the displacements, and the road velocity input equal to zero in the state
equations and solve for <span class="math">\(q_6,q_{11}\)</span>. Use these results as the initial
conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="inputs">
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<p>The single input to the model is the vertical velocity of the road as seen from
a reference frame that translates with the forward motion of the car. This
velocity will vary over time and be partially determined by the travel speed of
the car.</p>
<p>When the wheel hits the first part of the pothole, the wheel travels down
(positive for the bond graph) with a constant vertical velocity. Once the tire
reaches the bottom of the hole the wheel reverses its vertical direction and
travels up at the same speed. Assume that the profile of the pothole represents
the displacement of the point where the tire rubber meets the road. At the end
of the pothole, the wheel resumes a vertical velocity of zero.</p>
<p>The amount of time it takes for the tire to cross the pothole is
<span class="math">\(T=\frac{L}{V_c}\)</span>. Consequently, if the tire enters the pothole at
<span class="math">\(t=T_1\)</span>, the middle of the pothole occurs at <span class="math">\(T_2 = T_1 + T/2\)</span>, and
the tire leaves the pothole at <span class="math">\(T_3 = T_1 + T\)</span>. The vertical velocity is
given by <span class="math">\(V_c = \frac{dy}{dx}\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(\frac{dy}{dx}\)</span> is the slope
of the pothole. Using the slope, you can find an equation for the amplitude of
the velocity input.You will need to create a function that calculates this
input for any given time, <span class="math">\(t\)</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="time-duration-and-resolution">
<h2>Time Duration and Resolution</h2>
<p>You need to determine the desired maximum time step to ensure that the
simulation outputs capture all important variations with respect to time. To
determine the time step you need to think about the dynamics of the system.
Useful values to help you do so are the natural frequency and damping ratio of
the masses. For example, the natural frequency of the sprung mass is:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\omega_n = \sqrt{\frac{K}{M} \textrm{rad/s}
f_n = \frac{\omega_n}{2\pi} \textrm{Hz}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This gives you an estimate of the oscillation frequency of the system. Note
that you have two springs, each with different natural frequencies. You can
calculate the natural period of each to get an idea of the minimum time
resolution you may need.</p>
<p>The damping ratio of the sprung mass is:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\zeta = \frac{B}{2M\omega_n}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>For an over damped system, this gives you an estimate of of how fast the
oscillations will exponentially decay. Remember that the decay function takes
this form:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
e^{-2\zeta\omega_n t}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>You can figure out the time it takes to decay a particular percentage from this
equation. Popular times to check are &quot;time to half&quot; or calculating the time
constant <span class="math">\(tau\)</span>, which is the time it takes to decrease 63%. The time
constant is defined as:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
e^{-t/\tau}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>If the system oscillates very rapidly you will want a shorter time step. If the
oscillation is very slow or if there is a huge amount of damping, the time step
can be longer. Ensure that there are at least 10 data points per oscillation
for the shortest duration period you determine. Also, ensure that the total
duration of the simulation includes data up to a decay of 5% of the maximum.
Finally, inspect the simulation results and if you think that time resolution
doesn't show enough detail in parts of the motion, decrease the time step until
it does show sufficient detail. Be sure to explain what you choose and why.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="outputs">
<h2>Outputs</h2>
<p>One output that may be useful for a suspension engineer is the deflection of
the suspension relative to the equilibrium deflection. You may know that if the
suspension bottoms out, there may be damage to the car when hitting the
pothole. The deflection of the suspension is:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
q_(t) - q_{6}(t=0)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Remember a positive number represents compression. Include this output in your
report and be sure to discuss what you learn from it.</p>
<p>Another output that is useful is t he sprung mass acceleration, as this
acceleration will correlate to the forces the car's frame and the passengers
experience. Include this output and explain what you learn from it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="deliverables">
<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<p>Submit a report as a single PDF file to Canvas by the due date that addresses
the following items:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Create a function defined in an m-file that evaluates the right hand side of
the ODEs, i.e. evaluates the state derivatives. See <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme171/ode-integration-best-practices-with-octavematlab.html#defining-the-state-derivative-function">Defining the State

road. See <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme171/ode-integration-best-practices-with-octavematlab.html#time-varying-inputs">Time Varying Inputs</a> for an explanation.</li>
<li>Create a function defined in an m-file that calculates the two outputs:
suspension deflection and sprung mass acceleration. See <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme171/ode-integration-best-practices-with-octavematlab.html#outputs-other-than-the-states">Outputs Other Than

<li>Create a script in an m-file that utilizes the above functions to simulate
the suspension system traversing the pothole in the road. This should setup
the constants, integrate the dynamics equations, and plot each state, input,
and output versus time. See <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme171/ode-integration-best-practices-with-octavematlab.html#integrating-the-equations">Integrating the State Equations</a> for an
explanation.</li>
<li>From the plots above give your best estimation of the vibration period and
the frequency of the system. Explain how you determined these numbers.</li>
<li>Try changing only the damping ratio, <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span>, to a larger and smaller
value. Plot suspension deflection and acceleration for these new damping
ratios. What happens when <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span> decreases/increases? How does the
change in <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span> affect the mass acceleration?</li>
