TA Duties
=========

- Run lab sessions [4 hrs/wk]
- Grade labs [2 hr/wk]
- Grade homeworks [1 hr/wk]
- Co-grade exams [1 hr/wk]
- Instructor meeting [1 hr/wk]
- Answer questions via electronic and in-person [1 hr/wk]

General Notes
-------------

- Please log weekly hours in a spreadsheet in the Google Drive directory. The
  primary instructor uses this to gage TA workload and for future planning
  purposes.
- The instructors and TAs will have a 1 hour weekly instructor meeting to go
  over the upcoming week's activities. This should be arranged during the first
  meeting of the quarter.
- If you want to meet with Jason other than the instructor meeting, check his
  `work calendar`_ for an open weekday slot and send me a request via email.
- Jason primarily uses the Linux operating system and strives to use open
  source and free tools for most of his work. He prefers not to have to deal
  with any Microsoft Office Suite or other proprietary file types. Please avoid
  these and choose LibreOffice for Google equivalents so that we can easily
  collaborate and share.
- You can checkout a copy of the textbook from the MAE office for loan for the
  quarter.

Websites
========

Course Website
--------------

All of the public information about the course should go on the `course
website`_. The website source is at https://github.com/moorepants/eme171. Jason
is an advocate for open access teaching materials and attempts to make as much
of his materials available in this way. You'll need to make a GitHub account
and share your user name with Jason to get access to modify the website and
permission to edit the GitHub issues. See the README for instructions on
editing and viewing the site locally.

.. _course website: http://moorepants.github.io/eme171/

Canvas
------

Canvas_ will be used for private information related to the course that is
shared with the students, e.g. grades, copyrighted materials, announcements,
roster, email lists, solutions, etc. Request to be added to the roster as an
instructor.

Students should be directed to the Discussions section of the course Canvas
page to ask asynchronous questions electronically (instead of email). Any
question that could benefit more than one student should be asked here, so if
students email you directly, kindly direct them to Discussions. It is the
instructors' responsibility to answer these questions in a timely manner.
Consider enabling email notifications for discussion posts in your Canvas
account preferences.

Canvas's SpeedGrader system will be used to grade submitted assignments
(homework and lab reports). Rubrics will be added to each assignment and
SpeedGrader allows you to fill out the rubric for each group's submission and
add comments to the document for the students to see. We try to use electronic
submission and grading as much as possible to collect data for our and the
department's program assessment needs.

.. _Canvas: http://canvas.ucdavis.edu

Google Drive
------------

We will use a Google Drive folder for collaborative grading and sharing
information among the instructors. This folder should not be shared outside of
the instructors as it will have FERPA protected information. **You must be
extremely careful that you do not share any document in this drive directory
with any student.**

There will be two Google Drive folders. One private to instructors and one
meant for sharing with students and general public. Both folders will have only
the current instructors as collaborators (access to edit/view and change
permissions). Instructors will create new forms/documents meant for sharing in
the sharing folder, or create a copy in the private folder and move it to the
sharing folder (move works only if 'add to my drive' is done first on the
file). After the file to be shared is situated in the sharing folder,
permissions for that file can be changed to allow only students with the link
to view/edit the file. Folder level access will remain with the instructors.

Instructor Feedback
===================

Course feedback, issues, and enhancements are tracked on the `GitHub issues
page`_ for anything that we need to note for the future. **This is publicly
veiwable so no private information should be shared here.** These can be things
that need to fixed on the website, ideas for improving the course, things that
suck about the course, etc. Where appropriate, use the assignee and labels
features to help keep issues organized and easy to filter. Both TAs and the
instructor are responsible for maintaining and addressing this list.

Both TAs and instructors are expected to add to this instructor guide to help
improve the operation of the course in the future.

At the end of each quarter, all instructors should meet to reflect on how the
course/quarter went. Notes from this meeting should be added to the `Github
issues page`_ to benefit future instantiations of the course.

.. _Github issues page: https://github.com/moorepants/eme171/issues

Grading
=======

- All assignments should have a due time of 11:59pm on the due date, unless it
  needs to be done for class prep, i.e. due time is then the start of class.
- Assignments should be graded and returned within 1 week of their due date.
- All feedback on the submitted reports and documents should be given via the
  Speedgrader tool so that a digital record is kept of the embedded PDF
  comments, rubric scores, rubric comments, and assignment comments.
- Homeworks should be published 1 week in advance and labs 2 weeks.

Lab assignments
===============

Groups
------

Students will be in groups of 2 for the lab assignments 2 through 5. Every
student must turn in lab 1. The TA should create canvas groups letter A through
Z for random pairs of students before the second lab and announce these to the
students. The students can see and message their partner when they log in to
canvas.

For the second part of the class (lab 4 and 5), students self organize to form
groups of 2. If one student remains without a group, the student should be
added to another 2-person group.

Grading the Labs
----------------

The rubrics are created for each lab. On the labs, you need to grade the
contribution section. They have to **explicitly** detail the work each other
did. There is also points for clarity and following the correct format.

How the students can view instructor comments after grading
-----------------------------------------------------------

After your assignment has been graded, from the main course page you can go to
Grades > Click on the Report/Memo > Click on View Feedback in the top right.
You will be able to see an embedded version of the PDF with comments on the
right side. You may need to adjust the zoom settings to be able to see the
comments. You could also click the Download Icon on the embedded PDF window and
select Download Annotated PDF. You will need to open the PDF with an
application that supports comments (Adobe Reader, Foxit Reader etc.) to be able
to view the comments.

Homeworks
=========

Homework is given on a weekly basis. Grading the HW is only pass/no pass (can
have up to two excuses). No late submission is accepted for the homework. HWs
are graded in less than a week after submission. HW solutions are posted after
the deadline (the solution comes from the solution manual and latex-typed
solutions but has to be cut to have ONLY those specific questions asked in the
assignment). The TA is responsible for all these tasks.

HW6: This is a custom problem. Make sure everyone attempts to derive the bond
graph on their own for full credit. (bond graph of Lab 3, motocross)

Midterm reflection
==================

Please record 5 points for every student that turned in the midterm reflection
on time. There is an assignment in canvas for this.

Academic Integrity
==================

HWs and Labs should have unique solutions and the TA has to make sure that the
HWs are not copied from the solution manual by comparing them side-by-side.
Prof. Mooreâ€™s rule is that they have to turn in a "unique" solution. This means
no copying from manuals and no copying from other students.

In case of finding potential cheating on HW/Labs: 1. List each HW that looks
like the solution manual for each student. 2. Take a screenshot of the manual
beside their submission for evidence (side-by-side comparison). 3. Put the
screenshots in a folder on the drive and have the filenames be
lastname-firstname-hw02.png to organize. Do not discuss this with any students.
Report this to the instructor.

Answering Questions Via Email/Discussions/Etc.
==============================================

Answering the questions via email and discussions should be done within a day
and a half, in general, and less frequent on weekends. When we are close to the
exams we should up the rate. Unless the question is personal, we want students
to ask questions on discussions so that all students benefit from the answers.

Task Schedule
=============

Here is how I'd like things to flow each week:

- We collectively prep an agenda on GDrive in "meeting-notes" each week before
  our meeting by reviewing the instructor guide and adding anything else that
  comes up.
- We meet and discuss the plans, making action items.
- All action items that would happen each year should end up in the instructor
  guide so that these are missed in the future. The Lead TA should add these.
- All action items that need tracking, further discussion, etc, should end up
  in the Github issues page.
- We execute that week's plan.
- Rinse and repeat.
