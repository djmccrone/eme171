Introduction
============

Pictures below show an LOS model V-203 electrodynamic shaker. This small
precise tool is a mainstay of the vibration industry and it offers a perfect
target for analog simulation [1]_. The intent of this lab is to build and
simulate a model that accurately portrays the electrical and mechanical
characteristics of this machine and its interaction with a test piece.

Model Description
=================

Figure 2 shows a schematic of the system. The shaker has a compliant suspension
of stiffness :math:`K` and damping :math:`C` suspending a load-table of mass
:math:`M`. The table is driven by a voice-coil of resistance :math:`R` and
inductance :math:`L` which applies a force to the table in proportion to coil
current :math:`i` by a magnetic constant :math:`k_2`. The table motion is
resisted by the reaction force :math:`F_r` of the test object of mass
:math:`M_s`. The moving coil also generates a back EMF in proportion to table
velocity and the magnetic constant :math:`k_1`. The shaker is driven by a
voltage :math:`e_{\textrm{in}}` from a power amplifier. The test piece mass
structure support springs, :math:`K_s`, have negligible damping.

   **Figure 2** Schematic of the electrodynamic shaker (left side) connected to
   a test piece (right side) by the coupling spring.

Modify the shaker bond graph shown in Figure 3 to include a coupling spring and
a one degree-of-freedom model of the test piece structure shown in the diagram.
The reaction force :math:`F_r` will now come from the coupling spring (i.e.,
remove this effort source). On your new bond graph it would make more sense to
reverse the direction of the half arrow on the :math:`F_r` bond. Turn in a copy
of your bond graph including power convention and causal strokes as one of the
deliverables.

   **Figure 3** Schematic of the shaker showing key functional elements.

The pertinent equations are from the bond graph in Figure 3 are:

.. math::

   M \frac{dX^2}{dt^2} + C \frac{dX}{dt} + KX = k_2 i + F_r \\
   Ri + L \frac{di}{dt} = e_{in} - k_1 \frac{dX}{dt}

Note that the gyrator with constant :math:`k_1`, :math:`k_2` represents
:math:`e=k_1\dot{X}` andÂ :math:`k_2i=F`.

System Equations and State Variables
------------------------------------

You will need to arrive at the complete system's ordinary differential
equations from the modified bond graph and the provided equations, i.e. replace
:math:`F_r` with the force generated at the left end of the coupling spring.
You will need to determine all of the state variables. Show both the complete
differential equations and the list and names of the state variables your
report.

Constant Parameters
-------------------

The basic physics of the system are found in the governing differential
equations, and thus you are well on your way to building an analog simulation.
However, you need to know all of the coefficients in the equations as well as
the expected range of every variable before proceeding. Fortunately, there are
some useful numerical values garnered from analyzing it extensively for the
Electrodynamic Shaker Fundamentals article mentioned above. In particular, you
know:

- :math:`M_s = 0.7\textrm{kg}`: mass of the test piece
- :math:`M=178.04\times10^{-6} \frac{\textrm{lb sec}^2}{\textrm{in}}`: shaker
  table mass
- :math:`K = 16.54 \textrm{lb/in}`: shaker internal stiffness
- :math:`C = 39.09 \times 10^{-3} \frac{\textrm{lb sec}}{\textrm{in}}`: shaker
  internal damping
- :math:`R = 1.6 \Omega`: shaker coil resistance
- :math:`L = 764 \mu\textrm{H}`: shaker coil inductance
- :math:`k_1 = 95.10 \times 10^{-3} \frac{\textrm{Volt}}{\textrm{IPS}}`: shaker
  voltage-velocity proportionality coefficient
- :math:`k_2 = 0.8416 \frac{lb}{A}`: shaker force-current proportionality coefficient
- :math:`X_{\textrm{lim}} = \pm 100 \textrm{mm}`: maximum and minimum shaker stroke
- :math:`\ddot{X}_{\textrm{lim}}=\pm 135 \textrm{g}`: maximum shaker acceleration
- :math:`F_{\textrm{lim}}=\pm 4.4 \textrm{lb}`: maximum shaker force (use

Buy looking only at the test piece with the shaker is disconnected via the
coupling spring, compute a spring constant for the test piece support springs
such that the natural frequency, :math:`f_n` , of the support structure itself
is 20 Hz. Also compute the corresponding compliance (:math:`C_s =
\frac{1}{K_s}`).

You will need to convert the units given in the handout to the proper SI units
used in computation.

Inputs
------

Using the constants above and the system equations, compute the maximum
voltage, :math:`e_{in}`, that could be applied to the shaker if the force (on
the mechanical side of the gyrator) is limited to 4.4 lbs. (Hint: This is a
non-dynamic calculation involving only :math:`k_2` and :math:`R`.) Use this as
a constant input to the system in your simulation.

Initial Conditions
------------------

All initial conditions can be set to zero.

Simulation
==========

First let the coupling spring have a zero or nearly zero spring constant so
that the shaker is not affected by the presence of the structure. You can
either modify the equation for the spring from the form :math:`e_c =
\frac{q_c}{C_c}` to :math:`e_c = K_c q_c` and set :math:`K_c` to zero, or you
could use a very large number for :math:`C_c`.

Use zero initial conditions for all momentum displacement variables and let
:math:`e_{in}` from your power supply be the voltage you calculated. This
corresponds to suddenly turning on the maximum voltage at t = 0.

Simulate the system to see how the shaker behaves on its own. Report on the
findings in your deliverables.

Now do two more simulations with finite coupling spring constants (or
equivalent compliances). Experiment with the coupling spring constant; try it
with values less than the support spring constant and greater than the support
spring constant. Be careful of extremely large coupling spring constants, you
could create a system which would need a very small step size to be numerically
stable. Report on the findings of the two additional simulations in your
deliverables.

Time
----

You have to choose the maximum step size and stop time for the simulation based
on the considerations on the shortest period of oscillation or the shortest
time constant of the system. You will learn more about these characteristic
times of a system in Chapter 6 of the text. Approximates are:

.. class:: table table-striped table-bordered

======================== =========================================================
Oscillation frequency    :math:`\omega_n = \sqrt{\frac{K}{M}} \frac{\textrm{rad}}{\textrm{sec}}`
Period                   :math:`T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega_n} \textrm{sec}`
Mechanical time constant :math:`\tau_1 = \frac{M}{C} \textrm{sec}`
Electrical time constant :math:`\tau_2 = \frac{L}{R} \textrm{sec}`
======================== =========================================================

The default integration scheme, ode45(), is a variable-step Bogacki-Shampine
algorithm (Historical note: Prof. Bogacki taught Prof. Moore calculus in
undergrad!). The maximum step size guarantees data points at a regular interval
for plotting and analysis. Keep in mind that your max step size must be smaller
than the shortest period of oscillation or the shortest time constant of the
system. The stop time should be set such that most of the transient response
will occur for 0 < t < stop time.

Deliverables
============

1. A bond graph with power conventions, causal strokes, and linear coefficients
   for all ports.
2. Complete system equations and state variables defined.
3. A list of all constant parameters in acceptable SI units.
4. Show plots of your selected variables for the three cases simulated. Plot at
   least 4 variables you think would be of interest and explain why they are of
   interest.
5. Explanation of what you observe and learn about the system's motion from the
   three simulations.
6. Append a copy of your Matlab/Octave code to the end of the report.


The report should follow the `report template and guidelines
<{filename}/pages/report-template.rst>`_.


Code
----

1. Create a function defined in an m-file that evaluates the right hand side of
   the ODEs, i.e. evaluates the state derivatives. See `Defining the State
   Derivative Function`_ for an explanation.
2. Create a function defined in an m-file that calculates any necessary
   outputs. See `Outputs Other Than the States`_ and `Outputs Involving State
   Derivatives`_ for an explanation.
3. Create a script in an m-file that utilizes the above functions to simulate
   the system for three scenarios. This should setup the constants, integrate
   the dynamics equations, and plot each state, input, and output versus time.
   See `Integrating the State Equations`_ for an explanation.
