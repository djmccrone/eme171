Software
========

All of the simulations performed for assignments should be completed using
either Matlab or Octave. Matlab is available in the MAE CAE lab or you can
obtain a student license and install it on your own computer. Octave is a free
and open source clone of Matlab and is available for download at
https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ and thus can be installed on your own
computer.

The CAE lab also has a program called 20-Sim, see
https://www.20sim.com/features/model-libraries/bondgraphs, that provides an
interface for constructing bond graphs graphically and automatically generating
equations of motion code for simulation. We will not teach this software in the
class but you may be interested in learning it on your own.
