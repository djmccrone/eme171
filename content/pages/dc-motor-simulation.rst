:title: DC Motor Simulation
:status: hidden

This Matlab/Octave file demonstrates a simulation of a simple DC motor model
simulation.

simulate_dc_motor.m
===================

This is a basic simulation of the first order ordinary differential equations
of a DC motor with a specified voltage. In class, we wrote each of the three
functions as separate files, but you can include them all in one file as shown
below. To run this file, download it, set your Octave/Matlab path to the
directory where the file is and type `simulate_dc_motor` in the Octave/Matlab
terminal window.
