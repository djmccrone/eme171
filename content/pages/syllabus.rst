If it is impossible to make office hours, schedule an appointment with Jason by
checking his `work calendar`_ and select a free time between 8:00 AM and 6:30
PM Monday-Friday. Send him an email requesting an appointment at the suggested
meeting times at least a day in advance. You can also email the teaching
assistant and request a meeting.

Academic Integrity
==================

Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please visit the `Academic Integrity
web page <http://sja.ucdavis.edu/academic-integrity.html>`_ from UC Davis
Office of Student Judicial Affairs to review the campus' policy on academic
responsibility and integrity and read the UC Davis `code of academic conduct
<http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html>`_.

Feel free to discuss homework assignments and work on them together, but each
student must turn in a *unique* solution. Keep in mind that actually doing all
of the homework yourself is critical for learning and passing the course.

No help from other people or non-approved resources are allowed when completing
the midterm and final exam.

Textbook
========

We will use the following book as the official and required textbook:

   *System Dynamics: Modeling, Simulation, and Control of Mechatronic Systems*,
   Dean C. Karnopp, Donald L. Margolis, and Ronald C. Rosenberg, 5th Edition,
   2012, Wiley, ISBN 978-0-4708-8908-4 [`Book Information`_]

If connected through the UC Davis network, you can download a copy of the book
for free from the above link.

Past editions of the book are likely sufficient but the problem sets will not
necessarily match. We will also provide you with free online resources and
other supplementary materials.

Assignments & Grades
====================

Grades will be available in the canvas.ucdavis.edu_ grade book periodically
throughout the course along with class statistics. Check the website on a
regular basis to gauge your performance. Keep in mind that **15% is deducted
per business day late on lab reports. Homework must be turned in on time to
count.**

==================== =====
Homework             10%
Lab Reports          30%
Midterm              25%
Final                35%
==================== =====

Homework
   Weekly homework will be assigned from the book problems which will be due on
   Monday's by midnight (except during exam weeks). Unique solutions are
   required from each student but you are allowed to work with anyone on the
   homework and help each other. You can miss up to two homework submissions
   out of the total and still get the full 15% credit. Graded on pass/fail for
   showing complete work on all problems. There is no partial credit and
   homework will not be accepted past the due date and time. You should scan or
   photograph your homework and submit them as a single PDF file. Solutions
   will be shared after the due date on Canvas.
Lab Reports
   The labs will be done in pairs of two students. Each student is expected to
   contribute significantly to all aspects of the lab: understanding the
   problem, formulating a solution, writing code, and writing the report. Every
   student in the class is individually responsible for competence in
   simulation/analysis tools and methods used to complete the labs. Lab reports
   will be collected approximately every two weeks on Fridays and graded based
   on a provided rubric. Reports should be typed and submitted as a PDF file to
   Canvas. Each lab report due date will be preceded by multiple lab sessions
   lead by the teaching assistant. Each student is required to attend at least
   one of the lab sessions during the two week period before the lab report is
   due. Attendance will be taken and being absent will count against the pair's
   grade.
Midterm
   You will have to complete a 50 minute in-class midterm exam.
Final
   You will have to complete a two-hour in-class final exam.

Canvas
======

We will make use of Canvas for the course. Log in to canvas.ucdavis.edu_ with
your Kerberos ID and passphrase then select **EME 171 A01 WQ 2020**.

We will be using several features in canvas:

Announcements
   This will be my primary communication avenue to you. These announcements
   will be forwarded automatically to your UCD email address. You are expected
   to read these either through your email program or on the Canvas website.
Assignments
   Any electronic assignments will be distributed and collected here.
Discussions
   Ask all class related questions here unless they are of a personal nature.
Grades
   Your grades and basic stats on your relative performance will be available
   as the course goes along.
Files
   Copyrighted and private files, documents, and other resources will be
   available here for download. The rest will be available for download on this
   website.

Communications
==============

Canvas Discussions
------------------

Canvas discussions should be used for all questions about the class, homework,
theory, projects, etc that is not of a private nature. This allows both the
instructors and students to collectively answer questions for the whole classes
benefit.

Email
-----

Personal electronic correspondence from the instructors will be made to your
UCD email address. It is your responsibility to check this regularly.

Electronic announcements from the instructors to the whole class will be made
through Canvas. By default, Canvas will automatically send the announcement to
your UCD email address. You can change your Canvas settings to opt out, send it
to a different email, or as an SMS. You are responsible for reading the
announcements made via canvas.

Accomodation
============

The primary instructor should be informed of any learning accommodations at
least 1 full week before the desired accommodation is needed. I expect students
to contact me to discuss any special arrangements with 1 week time to make and
agree on the arrangements.
