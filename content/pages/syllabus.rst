Academic Integrity
==================

Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please visit the `Academic Integrity
web page <http://sja.ucdavis.edu/academic-integrity.html>`_ from UC Davis
Office of Student Judicial Affairs to review the campus' policy on academic
responsibility and integrity and read the UC Davis `code of academic conduct
<http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html>`_.

Feel free to discuss homework assignments and work on them together, but each
student must turn in a *unique* solution. Keep in mind that actually doing all
of the homework yourself is critical for learning and passing the course.

No help from other people is allowed when completing the midterm and final
exam.

Textbook
========

We will use the following book as the official and required textbook:

   *System Dynamics: Modeling, Simulation, and Control of Mechatronic Systems*,
   Dean C. Karnopp, Donald L. Margolis, and Ronald C. Rosenberg, 5th Edition,
   2012, Wiley, ISBN 978-0-4708-8908-4 [`Book Information`_]

Past editions of the book are likely sufficient but the problem sets will not
necessarily match. We will also provide you with free online resources and
other supplementary materials.

Projects
   Projects will be done in groups of three students; students are individually
   responsible for competence in simulation/analysis tools. Project reports
   will be collected and graded during the quarter.
Homework
   Weekly homework will be assigned which will be due before class the
   following week. Unique solutions are required from each student.
Midterm
   You will have to complete a one and half hour in-class midterm exam.
Final

Canvas
======

We will make use of Canvas for the course. Log in to canvas.ucdavis.edu_ with
your Kerberos ID and passphrase then select **EME 171 001 WQ 2019**.

We will be using several features in canvas:

Announcements
   This will be my primary communication avenue to you. These announcements
   will be forwarded automatically to your UCD email address. You are expected
   to read these either through your email program or on the Canvas website.
Assignments
   Any electronic assignments will be distributed and collected here.
Discussions
   Ask all class related questions here unless they are of a personal nature.
Grades
   Your grades and basic stats on your relative performance will be available
   as the course goes along.
Files
   Copyrighted and private files, documents, and other resources will be
   available here for download. The rest will be available for download on this
   website.

Communications
==============

Canvas Discussions
------------------

Canvas discussions should be used for all questions about the class, homework,
theory, projects, etc that is not of a private nature. This allows both the
instructors and students to collectively answer questions for the whole classes
benefit.

Email
-----

Personal electronic correspondence from the instructors will be made to your
UCD email address. It is your responsibility to check this regularly.

Electronic announcements from the instructors to the whole class will be made
through Canvas. By default, Canvas will automatically sends the announcement to
your UCD email address. You can change your Canvas settings to opt out, send it
to a different email, or as an SMS. You are responsible for reading the
announcements made via canvas.
